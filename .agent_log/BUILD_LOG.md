## USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS

29. **UX** - Extended page content with comprehensive AdTech educational material
30. **UX** - Increased sticky ad scroll trigger from 200px to 800px for more noticeable behavior
31. **UX** - Added visual scroll indicator showing progress toward sticky ad trigger point
32. **UX** - Implemented ad image rotation using actual images from ad-images/ directory
33. **UX** - Enhanced content sections with highlight boxes and scroll indicator styling

### Image Rotation System:
- **Banner Ad**: Starts with grumpy-cat.jpg, rotates on refresh
- **Sticky Ad**: Uses jumping-cat.avif, rotates when triggered via scroll
- **Interstitial Ad**: Rotates through images each time modal is opened
- **Console Logging**: Shows which image is loaded for debugging

### Scroll Enhancement Details:
- **Trigger Point**: 800px scroll depth (4x increase from original 200px)
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time progress bar showing scroll percentage
- **Clear Indicator**: Highlighted section showing exact trigger zone
- **Success Feedback**: Progress bar updates to show "triggered" state

**TOTAL BUILD ACTIONS: 34 discrete implementation steps logged**

## IMAGE SERVING FIX

35. **FIX** - Added static file serving for ad-images directory in Express server
36. **FIX** - Updated Vite proxy configuration to serve /ad-images from backend
37. **FIX** - Removed Windows Zone.Identifier files that could cause serving issues
38. **FIX** - Added error handling and fallback for failed image loads

### Image Serving Solution:
- **Backend**: Express serves `/ad-images` from `../ad-images/` directory
- **Frontend**: Vite proxies `/ad-images` requests to backend server
- **Error Handling**: Falls back to placeholder if real images fail to load
- **Debug Tool**: "Test Ad Images" button in debug panel checks accessibility

**TOTAL BUILD ACTIONS: 39 discrete implementation steps logged**

**TOTAL BUILD ACTIONS: 60 discrete implementation steps logged**

## BUY NOW FUNCTIONALITY FIX

61. **FIX** - Separated "Buy Now" from cart functionality to prevent modal overlap
62. **FIX** - Made "Buy Now" create independent purchases without affecting cart state
63. **FIX** - Fixed price accumulation bug where "Buy Now" totals were piling up
64. **TRACKING** - Added dedicated "buy_now" event type to distinguish from cart-based purchases
65. **TRACKING** - Added "purchase_type" flag to purchase events ("buy_now" vs "cart_checkout")

### Buy Now vs Add to Cart Behavior:
- **Add to Cart**: Adds item to persistent cart → shows cart modal → can proceed to checkout
- **Buy Now**: Creates immediate independent purchase → bypasses cart entirely → shows success message
- **No Overlap**: Buy Now never shows cart modal or affects cart contents
- **Separate Tracking**: Different event types for analytics differentiation

### Fixed Issues:
- ❌ **Before**: Buy Now showed cart modal briefly before checkout
- ✅ **After**: Buy Now goes directly to purchase success
- ❌ **Before**: Buy Now added items to cart causing accumulation
- ✅ **After**: Buy Now creates independent transactions
- ❌ **Before**: Multiple Buy Now clicks accumulated prices
- ✅ **After**: Each Buy Now is separate with correct individual pricing
